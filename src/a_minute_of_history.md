# A minute of history

* Git was created by the creator of the Linux operating system - Linus Torvalds.
* Initially, it was used to manage the versions of the source code of the Linux kernel.
* The initial version was created in 3 days.
* The assumptions for his creation were the following:
  - Incorporate the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do. If in doubt, make the exact opposite decision.
  - Supports a BitKeeper-like distributed workflow.
  - Consideration of very strong safeguards against data corruption, both by accidental and deliberate action. What has been achieved.
