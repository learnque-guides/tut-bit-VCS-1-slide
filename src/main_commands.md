# Main commands

* `git add` - adds a file (or files) to the index - it causes their "tracking" by the git. The operation is performed after each modification of the file that we intend to manage (or we have managed already) using the repository.
* git add `<file name>` or git add `<name 1> <name 2> ...` or `git add .` (add all). 
* `git commit` - send files that have been modified (and are in the index file) to the local repository.
The operation is performed after each modification of indexed / tracked files.
* `git commit` (will open the file inside which you will be able to enter information
on the introduced changes)
* `git commit â€“m "message about the changes"`
