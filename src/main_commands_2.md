# Main commands II

* git push - sends modified files from the local repository (updates files) to the remote repository. The operation is performed every time when we want to update the state of our remote repository with local commits (changes).

```bash
git push 
```

* git pull - it downloads files (updates) from the remote repository and tries to automatically update their counterparts in the local (workspace) repository. The operation should be performed before each "push" operation.

```bash
git push 
```
