# Set up private, public key

* If we want to use one of the repository hosting platforms like github or gitlab we need to set up public and private ssh keys.
* It's also possible to use http authentication, but ssh keys is preffered method to authenticate.

Let's try to follow this instructions:

[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

or

[https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/)

Ommit that parts that tels for you to add that key in github or bitbucket hosting platform. We will do that later.
