# What PR is and how it looks?

It is common practise that during development, developers review of each other code.

When developer start working on task, he creates a feature branch from main branch. After work is finished, developer creates a PR in github, gitlab or bitbucket and add other developers for code review.

In most cases at least two developers should approve PR before it can be merged.

Let's look how it looks in practice.
